### Task #1

We will store source code of our `OnlineStore` in GitHub. Before start, you should read and 
understand git principals and main git commands.

- Start new branch out of main branch.
- Give it a name like `01git`, or `task1-git`, or anything suitable.
- Change something in this newly created branch. For example, add a couple of lines into README.md file, or add a new file, or delete existing one.
- Create a pull request from your branch to main branch, and assign it to your trainer.
